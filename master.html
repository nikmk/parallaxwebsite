    <p>
      Up until 1920, most astronomers believed that all of the stars in the universe were contained inside the Milky Way. Following this Great Debate, observations by Edwin Hubble proved that the Milky Way is in fact just one of billions of galaxies in the universe.

      Black Sky
    </h2>
    <p>
    Black holes are both strange and amazing, and the study of them has kept scientists busy and excited for the past century. They are an area of space that nothing can escape from once it has entered it—not even light. The ability to absorb all light around them and the way they reflect none of it is why they are referred to as “black.”

      Upon shower
    </h2>
    <p>
      A meteor shower happens when a comet orbits the Sun and it sheds a dusty and icy debris stream along its orbit path. If Earth happens to be travelling through this stream, this is when you’ll see a meteor shower.

The meteors can appear anywhere in the sky, but if you trace their path back up they appear to “rain” in from the same region of the sky.
